# Requirements
Formal descriptions of what needs to be built, commonly categorized as functional, non-functional, and constraints.

## Functional
The behaviors and features an application must have. They specify what the system should do to meet user needs, defining the application's required functionality based on user actions, events, and/or business processes.

### Core Behaviors &amp; Features:
- User authentication to access a personalized TODO list.
- Users can read a list of personal TODO items.
- Users can create TODO items to the list.
- Users can mark TODO items on the list as complete.

### Optional Behaviors &amp; Features:
- Edit TODO items (e.g., update title, description, or details).
- Assign priority levels to TODO items.
- Set deadlines for TODO items.
- Delete TODO items from the list.
- Filter TODO items by attributes like status, priority, due date, or alphabetical order.

## Non-Functional
Specify the quality attributes that enhance the application's usability, reliability, and performance but are not critical for basic operations.

### Core Attributes:
- The app must be responsive and functional across desktop and mobile devices.
- User interactions should have minimal response times.
- The back-end should be scalable to accommodate increasing numbers of users and tasks.
- User data must be securely stored, following best practices for encryption and data privacy.

### Optional Attributes:
- Accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG standards).
- High availability and fault tolerance to ensure uptime.

## Constraints
Constraints define the limitations within which the system must operate.

- Tasks must persist between sessions using methods like `localStorage`, database, or cloud.
- App doesnâ€™t support offline mode, requires a stable internet connection.
- Source code must be stored on GitHub.
- Deployment must utilize AWS services.
- The project must operate within a limited budget and be open-source.
- The application is web-based only and will not include native iOS or Android versions.
