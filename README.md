# Practice React TODO App

Repository for practicing React and front-end system design using a TODO app as the subject.

# Requirements

Formal descriptions of what needs to be built, commonly categorized as functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and constraints.

## Functional

Functional requirements are the behaviors and features a software application must have. They specify what the system should do to meet user needs, defining the application's required functionality based on user actions, events, and/or business processes.

### Core
- Users can create items from the TODO list
- Users can delete items from the TODO list
- Users can mark item as complete

### Additional
- Users can update items from the TODO list
- Users can filter tasks via category (completed, priority, date, alpha, etc...)
- Users can set priority on items
- Users can set deadlines

## Non-Functional
- Users can login and view a personal TODO list

## Constraints
- Must store tasks so they persist between sessions (e.g., using localStorage, a database, or cloud syncing)
